## Importance :point_down:

<div align="justified">

One of the most important reasons we should use a to do list is that it will help us stay organised. When we write all your tasks in a list, they seem more manageable. When we’ve got a clear outline of the tasks we’ve got to do and those we’ve completed, it helps us stay focused. While freeing up space in our mind for other more creative tasks.
When we complete a task, you can cross it off our list. This gives you a sense of progress and achievement, something we’ll lack if we’re always rushing from one task to the next. If we feel a sense of achievement, it spurs us on and motivates us to keep moving forward.
